                                In C, static storage class cannot be used with:

                                (A) Global variable

                                (B) Function parameter

                                (C) Function name

                                (D) Local variable
@

$B$

                                Explanation: 
                                Declaring a global variable as static limits its scope to the same file in which it is defined. 
                                A static function is only accessible to the same file in which it is defined. 
                                A local variable declared as static preserves the value of the variable between the function calls.
