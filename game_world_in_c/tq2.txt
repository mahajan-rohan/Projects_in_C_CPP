                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include <iostream>
                                using namespace std;
                                void func(int a, bool flag = true)
                                {
                                    if (flag == true ) 
                                    {
                                        cout << "Flag is true. a = " << a;
                                    }
                                    else 
                                    {
                                        cout << "Flag is false. a = " << a;
                                    }
                                }
                                int main()
                                {
                                    func(200, false);
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) Flag is true. a = 200

                                (B) Flag is false. a = 100

                                (C) Flag is false. a = 200

                                (D) Flag is true. a = 100

                                Explanation: 
                                In this program, we are passing the value, 
                                as it evaluates to false, it produces the output as following.
                                Output:
                                Flag is false. a = 200
