                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include <iostream>
                
                                class Test
                                {
                                public:
                                    void fun();
                                };
                                static void Test::fun()   
                                {
                                    std::cout<<"fun() is static";
                                }
                                int main()
                                {
                                    Test::fun();   
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) fun() is static

                                (B) Compile-time Error

                                (C) Run-time error

                                (D) Nothing is printed

                                Explanation: 
                                The prototype of the functions are not matched. 
                                The function declared inside a class does not have static linkage 
                                however the class defined outside the class has the static linkage,
                                therefore, the program gives an error.
