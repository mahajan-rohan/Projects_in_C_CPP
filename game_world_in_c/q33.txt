                                Which of the following statement is true about the new and malloc?

                                1. The "new" is a type of operator while "malloc" is a kind of function

                                2. "new" invokes a constructor, whereas "malloc" does not invoke the constructor

                                3.  "malloc" returns void pointer and also needed to typecast whereas "new" returns required the pointer

                                (A) Only 1

                                (B) Both 1 & 2

                                (C) 1,2,3

                                (D) None of the above

                                Explanation: 
                                All statements mentioned in the above question are completely true
                                about the "malloc" and the "new." The "malloc" is a kind of function 
                                available in the C++ language, while the "new" is a type of operator 
                                that invokes the Constructor.
