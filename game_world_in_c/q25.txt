                                A pointer is a memory address. Suppose the pointer variable has p address 1000,
                                and that p is declared to have type int*, and an int is 4 bytes long. 
                                What address is represented by expression p + 2?

                                (A) 1002

                                (B) 1004

                                (C) 1006

                                (D) 1008

                                Explanation: 
                                In pointer arithmetic, when we add or subtract a value from a ponter varible is basically
                                deals with the size of the data type defined as pointer of.
                                Suppose, in above example the pointer is of char then the answer would be 1002, 
                                as char has a size of 1 byte only and p+2 will be 1002
