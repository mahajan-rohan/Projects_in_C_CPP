                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include <iostream>
                                using namespace std;

                                int main()
                                {
                                    try
                                    {
                                    throw 'a';
                                    }
                                    catch (int param)
                                    {
                                        cout << "int exceptionn";
                                    }
                                    catch (...)
                                    {
                                        cout << "default exceptionn";
                                    }
                                    cout << "After Exception";
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) default exception
                                    After Exception

                                (B) int exception
                                    After Exception

                                (C) int exception

                                (D) default exception

                                Explanation: 
                                The block catch(...) is used for catch all, when a data type of a thrown exception 
                                doesn't match with any other catch block, the code inside catch(...) is executed. 
                                Note that the implicit type conversion doesn't happen when exceptions are caught. 
                                The character 'a' is not automatically converted to int.
