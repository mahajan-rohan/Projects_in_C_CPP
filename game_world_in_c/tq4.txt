                                How many times will the print statement be executed?

                                main(){
                                    int i = 0;
                                    label:
                                    cout << "Interviewbit";
                                    i++;
                                    if(i < 3){
                                        goto label;
                                    }       
                                }

                                (A) 1 Time

                                (B) 2 Times

                                (C) 3 Times

                                (D) compile time error

                                Explanation: 
                                Interviewbit will be printed 3 times, since for every if i < 3, 
                                it goes to label and an iteration occurs.
