                                In C++, for what purpose the "rank()" is used?

                                (A) It returns the size of each dimension

                                (B) It returns the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the array

                                (C) It returns the dimension of the specified array

                                (D) None of the above

                                Explanation: 
                                In C++, one can use the rank function where he wants to 
                                know about the dimensions( e.g., single-dimension, multi-dimension) 
                                of a specific array by just passing it to the "rank()" function.
