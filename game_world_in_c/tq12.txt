                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include<iostream>
                    
                                using namespace std;
                                class Base1 {
                                public:
                                    Base1()
                                    { cout << " Base1's constructor called" << endl;  }
                                };

                                class Base2 {
                                public:
                                    Base2()
                                    { cout << "Base2's constructor called" << endl;  }
                                };

                                class Derived: public Base1, public Base2 {
                                public:
                                    Derived()
                                    {  cout << "Derived's constructor called" << endl;  }
                                };

                                int main()
                                {
                                Derived d;
                                return 0;
                                }

                                (B) Base1 constructor called

                                Explanation: 
                                When a class inherits from multiple classes, constructors of base classes 
                                are called in the same order as they are specified in inheritance
