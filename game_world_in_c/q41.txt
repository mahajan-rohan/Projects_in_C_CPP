                            Explanation: 
                            Modularity refers to dividing a program into small independent code blocks or modules 
                            so that they can be easily called anywhere in the entire program where it is required. 
                            The concept of Modularity is very efficient and helpful for developers because it makes 
                            the program well structured and easy to understand.
