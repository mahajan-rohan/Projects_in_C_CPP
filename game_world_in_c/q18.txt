                                What is the output of this C code?

                                #include <stdio.h>
                                int main()
                                {
                                    float f = 0.1;
                                    if (f == 0.1)
                                        printf("True");
                                    else
                                        printf("False");
                                }

                                (A) True

                                (B) False

                                (C) No Output will be printed

                                (D) Run Time Error

                                Explanation: 
                                This is because the float variable "f" is assigned the value of 0.1, which is a decimal number.
                                However, decimal numbers cannot be represented precisely in binary floating-point format used 
                                by computers, and therefore, the actual value stored in the "f" variable may not be exactly 0.1.

                                When the "if" statement is executed, it checks if the value of "f" is equal to 0.1. 
                                Since the binary representation of the value stored in "f" may not be exactly 0.1, 
                                the condition may not be true, and the "else" block will be executed, resulting 
                                in the output "False".
