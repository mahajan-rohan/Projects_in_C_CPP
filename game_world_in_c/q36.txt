                                Which of the following can be used to create an abstract class in the C++ programming language?

                                (A) By using the pure virtual function in the class

                                (B) By declaring a virtual function in the base class

                                (C) By declaring the virtual keyword afterward, the class Declaration

                                (D) None of the above

                                Explanation: 
                                A class must contain at least one declaration of the pure virtual function in 
                                itself to be called an abstract class.Therefore to make an abstract class, 
                                one has to declare at least one pure virtual function in that class.
