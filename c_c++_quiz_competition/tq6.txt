                                How many times Hello Will be printed in the below C code ?

                                #include <stdio.h>
                                int main()
                                {
                                    int k,j;
                                    for (k=0;k<=10;k+=2)
                                    {
                                        for(j=1;j!=k;j=j+1)
                                        {
                                            printf("Hello\n");
                                            break;
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                                (A) 10 Times

                                (B) 5 Times

                                (C) 6 Times

                                (D) Infinite Times

                                Explanation: 
                                for j=1, the inner for loop is always executed. 
                                Thus, it will print Hello and come out of the inner loop.
                                Thus, hello will be printed six times (i.e. for k=0,2,4,6,8 and 10).
