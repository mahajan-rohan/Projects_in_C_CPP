                                What is the output of the above program?

                                #include <stdio.h>
                                #if X == 3
                                    #define Y 3
                                #else
                                    #define Y 5
                                #endif

                                int main()
                                {
                                    printf("%d", Y);
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) 3 

                                (B) 5 

                                (C) 3 or 5 depending on value of  

                                (D) Compile time error

                                Explanation: 
                                In the first look, the output seems to be compile-time error 
                                because macro X has not been defined. In C, if a macro is not defined, 
                                the pre-processor assigns 0 to it by default. Hence, the control goes
                                to the conditional else part and 5 is printed.
