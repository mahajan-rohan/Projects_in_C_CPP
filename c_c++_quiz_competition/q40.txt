                                How are the references different from the pointer?

                                (A) A reference cannot be modified once it initialized

                                (B) here is no need of an extra operator for dereferencing of a reference

                                (C) A reference cannot be NULL

                                (D) All of above

                                Explanation: 
                                These are some basic reasons why the references are far different from the pointers.
                                In the case of pointers "*" operator is required for dereferencing the value contain by it. 
                                However, the reference does not need any type of operator for deference.
                                A Reference cannot be modified once it is initialized, but it is possible to do so in the case of a pointer.
                                A pointer can be made Null, whereas a reference cannot be NULL.
