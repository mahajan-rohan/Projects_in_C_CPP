                                (A) Functions can return any type 

                                (B) Functions can return any type except array and functions 

                                (C) Functions can return any type except array, functions and union

                                Explanation: 
                                In C, functions can return any type except arrays and functions.
                                We can get around this limitation by returning pointer to array or pointer to function.
