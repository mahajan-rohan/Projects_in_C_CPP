								What is the output of the above program?

								#include "stdio.h"

								int main(){ 
									int x, y = 5, z = 5; 
									x = y == z; 
									return 0; 
								}

								(A) 0 

								(B) 1 

								(C) 5 

								(D) Compiler Error
@

$B$

~ 
								Explanation: 
								The crux of the question lies in the statement x = y==z. 
								The operator == is executed before = because precedence of comparison operators 
								(<=, >= and ==) is higher than assignment operator =. 
								The result of a comparison operator is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison result. 
								Since y is equal to z, value of the expression y == z becomes 1 
								and the value is assigned to x via the assignment operator.
