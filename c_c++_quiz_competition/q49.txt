                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include <iomanip>
                                #include <iostream>
                                using namespace std;
                                int main()
                                {
                                    cout << setprecision(17);
                                    double d = 0.1;
                                    cout << d << endl;
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) 0.11

                                (B) 0.10000000000000001

                                (C) 0.100001

                                (D) compile time error

                                Explanation: 
                                The double had to truncate the approximation due to its limited memory, 
                                which resulted in a number that is not exactly 0.1
                                Output: 0.10000000000000001
