								What will be the output of the following C++ code?

								#include <iostream>
								using namespace std;
								int main()
								{
									int x = -1;
									try {
										cout << "Inside try n";
											if (x < 0)
										{
											throw x;
											cout << "After throw n";
										}
								}
								catch (int x ) {
								cout << "Exception Caught n";
								}

								cout << "After catch n";
								return 0;
								}
