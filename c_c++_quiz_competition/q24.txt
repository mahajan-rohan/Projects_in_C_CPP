                                How many times will the following loop execute?

                                for(j = 1; j <= 10; j = j-1) 

                                (A) Forever

                                (B) Never

                                (C) 0 times

                                (D) 1 time only

                                Explanation: 
                                As the j will iitialize will 1 then condition 1<=10 is true 
                                then the value of j will bw modified to j=j-1 i.e j=1-1=0
                                so now the j is zero.Therefore, the condition will always 
                                be true as j will modify to negative values which are less than 10
