                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include<iostream>
                                using namespace std;
                                int x = 1;
                                int main()
                                {
                                    int x = 2;
                                    {
                                        int x = 3;
                                        cout << ::x << endl;
                                    }
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) 1

                                (B) 2

                                (C) 3

                                (D) 123

                                Explanation: 
                                While printing x we are using :: operator hence the refernce is 
                                given to global variable hence the global variable x = 1 is printed.
