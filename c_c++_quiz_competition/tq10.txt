                                What will be the output of the following C++ code?

                                #include<iostream>
                                using namespace std;
                                
                                class Base
                                {
                                public:
                                    virtual void show() { cout<<" In Base n"; }
                                };
                                
                                class Derived: public Base
                                {
                                public:
                                    void show() { cout<<"In Derived n"; }
                                };
                                
                                int main(void)
                                {
                                    Base *bp = new Derived;
                                    bp->show();
                                
                                    Base &br = *bp;
                                    br.show();
                                
                                    return 0;
                                }

                                (A) In Base 
                                    In Base 

                                (B) In Base 
                                    In Derived

                                (C) In Derived
                                    In Derived

                                (D) In Derived
                                    In Base

                                Explanation: 
                                Since show() is virtual in base class, it is called according 
                                to the type of object being referred or pointed, rather 
                                than the type of pointer or reference.
