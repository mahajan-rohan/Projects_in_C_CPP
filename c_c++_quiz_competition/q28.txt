                                Which of the following features must be supported by any programming 
                                language to become a pure object-oriented programming language?

                                (A) Encapsulation

                                (B) Inheritance

                                (C) Polymorphism

                                (D) All of the above

                                Explanation: 
                                There is nothing that forces a user to use the OOP concept in C++.
                                In contrast, it is necessary for a programming language that it 
                                must support all three features as encapsulation, inheritance, 
                                and polymorphism completely to become a pure Object-Oriented 
                                Language.
